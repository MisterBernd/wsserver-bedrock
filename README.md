# wsserver-bedrock
<b>A wsserver for bedrock</b>
<br>
To run the server on Windows, use the runServer_Windows.exe.
If you want to use it on other systems, you need to install node.js and afterwards you are able to run runServer_Other.sh
<br>

The wsserver sends some commands to your client:
<br>

title --> Websocket connection successful

summon --> tnt (test it in a world you don't need)
